# autoencoder_for_physical_layer
This is my attempt to reproduce the results in the paper "An Introduction to Deep Learning for the PHysical Layer" by Tim O'Shea and Jakob Hoydis. Available at https://doi.org/10.1109/TCCN.2017.2758370

The implementation uses Keras with a tensorflow backend on Jupyter Notebook.
